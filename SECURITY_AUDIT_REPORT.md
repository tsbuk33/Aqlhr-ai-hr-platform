# 🔒 AqlHR Platform Security Audit Report
*Automated Security Assessment & Remediation Plan*

## 🚨 Executive Summary

**CRITICAL:** This AqlHR platform requires immediate security hardening before production deployment. Our automated audit identified **60 critical database security violations** and **missing authentication system**.

**Risk Level:** 🔴 **HIGH RISK** - Immediate action required

---

## 📊 Automated Audit Results

### Supabase Database Linter Results
**Date:** `$(date)`
**Total Issues Found:** 60 critical security violations

#### Critical Finding: RLS Enabled but No Policies
- **Issue Type:** RLS Enabled No Policy  
- **Severity Level:** INFO (but CRITICAL impact)
- **Description:** Row Level Security enabled on tables but no RLS policies created
- **Security Impact:** 🔴 **COMPLETE DATA EXPOSURE** - Any authenticated user can access ALL company data
- **Documentation:** [Supabase RLS Policy Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0008_rls_enabled_no_policy)

#### Affected Tables (60+ tables with no RLS policies):
All core business tables are exposed:
- `employees` - Complete employee data accessible to any user
- `attendance` - All attendance records visible across companies  
- `performance_reviews` - Confidential performance data exposed
- `leave_requests` - Personal leave information accessible
- `payroll_*` tables - Salary and compensation data exposed
- `ai_*` tables - AI insights and recommendations exposed
- And 50+ more critical business tables...

#### Sample Failing Security Test:
```sql
-- Any authenticated user can currently execute:
SELECT * FROM employees; -- Returns ALL employees from ALL companies
SELECT * FROM performance_reviews; -- Access to confidential reviews
SELECT * FROM ai_recommendations; -- Access to AI insights across companies
```

## 🛡️ Actionable Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Database Security (Week 1)
**Goal:** Stop data leakage between companies immediately

#### 1.1 Critical RLS Policy Implementation
**Pull Request 1: Employee Data Protection**
- [ ] Add company-scoped RLS policy for `employees` table
- [ ] Test: User from Company A cannot see Company B employees
- [ ] Validation script: `scripts/test-employee-isolation.sql`

**Pull Request 2: HR Data Protection** 
- [ ] Add RLS policies for `performance_reviews`, `leave_requests`, `attendance`
- [ ] Test: Multi-company data isolation verification
- [ ] Validation script: `scripts/test-hr-data-isolation.sql`

**Pull Request 3: AI & Analytics Protection**
- [ ] Add RLS policies for all `ai_*` tables and `system_*` tables
- [ ] Test: AI recommendations isolated per company
- [ ] Validation script: `scripts/test-ai-isolation.sql`

#### 1.2 Authentication System Implementation
**Pull Request 4: Supabase Auth Integration**
- [ ] Create `AuthContext` with Supabase integration
- [ ] Add login/logout UI components
- [ ] Test: Unauthenticated users redirected to login

**Pull Request 5: Route Protection**
- [ ] Protect `/employees` page first (pilot implementation)
- [ ] Add route guard middleware
- [ ] Test: Unauthorized access blocked with redirect

**Pull Request 6: Complete Route Protection**
- [ ] Extend protection to all sensitive routes
- [ ] Add role-based access controls
- [ ] Test: Full authentication flow end-to-end

### Phase 2: Input Validation & XSS Protection (Week 2)
**Goal:** Prevent injection attacks and secure user inputs

#### 2.1 Form Security Hardening
**Pull Request 7: Input Validation**
- [ ] Apply validation utilities consistently across all forms
- [ ] Add server-side validation for API endpoints
- [ ] Test: Malicious input rejection

**Pull Request 8: XSS Protection**
- [ ] Audit `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage in chart components
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Test: XSS attack prevention

### Phase 3: Continuous Security Guardrails (Week 3)
**Goal:** Automated security enforcement

#### 3.1 GitHub Actions Security Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Checks
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: ESLint Security Rules
        run: npm run lint:security
      - name: Supabase RLS Policy Check
        run: npm run audit:rls
      - name: End-to-End Security Test
        run: npm run test:security
```

#### 3.2 Automated RLS Policy Validation
**Daily Security Check:**
- [ ] Automated script to verify all tables have RLS policies
- [ ] Alert system for policy violations
- [ ] Nightly company data isolation test

#### 3.3 Security Test Suite
**Multi-Company Isolation Test:**
```typescript
// scripts/security-tests/company-isolation.test.ts
describe('Company Data Isolation', () => {
  it('should prevent cross-company data access', async () => {
    // Login as Company A user
    // Attempt to access Company B data
    // Assert: Access denied
  });
});
```

## 🔧 Security Tooling Implementation

### 1. Security Linter Integration
```bash
# Add to package.json scripts
"lint:security": "eslint . --config .eslintrc.security.js",
"audit:rls": "npx tsx scripts/audit-rls-policies.ts",
"test:security": "npm run test:security-e2e"
```

### 2. RLS Policy Template
```sql
-- Template for all new tables
CREATE POLICY "Company isolation policy" ON public.{table_name}
  USING (company_id = get_user_company_id());
```

### 3. Security Validation Script
```typescript
// scripts/validate-security.ts
export async function validateTableSecurity(tableName: string) {
  // Check if RLS is enabled
  // Verify policies exist
  // Test cross-company access prevention
}
```
