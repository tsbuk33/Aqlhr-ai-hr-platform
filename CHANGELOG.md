**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All 600+ AqlHR platform pages now accessible and functional

### 2025-08-25 - ACTION 3 Analysis: Employee Master Data Status Check
**User Input:** "Aqlhr already has the Employee Master Data page"
**Analysis Results:** Multiple employee implementations found but missing ACTION 3 requirements:

#### Current Implementation Issues:
- **Multiple Scattered Pages**: `Employees.tsx` (placeholder), `EmployeeList.tsx` (partial), `EmployeePage.tsx`, `EmployeesPage.tsx` 
- **Missing Bilingual Routing**: No `/en/employees` and `/ar/employees` route structure
- **No Role-gated PII**: No PDPL-compliant data masking for non-admin users
- **Client-side Only**: No server-side pagination or database RPC functions
- **No Dev Seeding**: Missing `dev_seed_employees_v1` functionality
- **Basic Exports**: No PDPL-compliant CSV/PDF with proper filenames and disclaimers

#### ACTION 3 Gap Analysis:
‚ùå Bilingual routes (/en/employees, /ar/employees)  
‚ùå Server-side pagination with `hr_employees_list_v1` RPC  
‚ùå Role-gated PII masking (name_masked, iqama_last4)  
‚ùå PDPL-compliant exports with disclaimers  
‚ùå Dev seeding with `?dev=1` parameter

**Issue:** Enhanced retention data seeding and created AI-powered action generation system
**Impact:** Major Feature Enhancement - Improved data quality and AI integration for retention module
**Resolution:** Upgraded retention data pipeline with realistic feature generation and Ask Aql integration

#### Database Enhancements:
- **Enhanced `dev_seed_retention_v1` RPC** - Now generates comprehensive retention features including:
  - Risk scores (0-100) with realistic distribution
  - Employee tenure, salary percentiles, performance ratings
  - Manager relationship scores, commute distances, training hours
  - Promotion eligibility, flight risk indicators
  - Exit simulation with random resignation/termination dates and reasons
- **Improved data realism** - Features now correlate logically (high performers get promotions, long commutes increase flight risk)
- **Tenant-scoped data integrity** - All operations properly scoped to prevent cross-tenant data contamination

#### AI Integration:
- **Created `agent-retention-plan-v1` Edge Function** - AI-powered action generation system
  - Integrates with Ask Aql for retention strategy recommendations

1. Enhancing the data quality that feeds into the overview, drivers, and watchlist components
2. Adding the missing AI action generation capability that was mentioned but not fully implemented
3. Maintaining all existing functionality while improving the underlying data pipeline

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Enhanced retention system with realistic data and AI integration

### 2025-01-25 - Retention v1 Database Type Safety Fix
**Issue:** `retention_drivers_v1` RPC failing with "function avg(text) does not exist" error
**Impact:** Critical Bug Fix - Prevents retention data from loading in UI
**Resolution:** Added proper type validation and JSONB field handling

#### Technical Fix:
- **Enhanced `retention_drivers_v1` RPC** - Added regex pattern matching (`~ '^[0-9\.]+$'`) to validate numeric values in JSONB fields before casting
- **Prevented type conversion errors** - Using CASE statements to handle non-numeric values gracefully
- **Maintained data integrity** - Ensures only valid numeric JSONB fields are processed by AVG() function

#### Root Cause:
- JSONB features in `retention_features` table can contain mixed data types
- Direct casting `(rf.features->>'field')::numeric` fails when field contains text values
- PostgreSQL AVG() function requires numeric input, not text

**Connection to Previous Work:** This fixes a critical blocker preventing the QA testing outlined in the user's acceptance checklist. The retention UI can now properly load and display data from the enhanced seeding system implemented on 2025-01-25.

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Database type safety issue resolved, retention system ready for QA
