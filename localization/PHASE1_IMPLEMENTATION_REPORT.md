# AqlHR Localization Governance Implementation Report

## Phase 1: Localization Governance & Glossary - COMPLETED

### Implementation Summary
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive localization governance system for the AqlHR platform that establishes a single source of truth for all HR terminology and enforces consistent usage across the codebase.

---

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Central Term Bank (`localization/terms.yaml`)
✅ **Created comprehensive terminology database with:**
- **Business Terms**: 29 core HR concepts (Employee, Probation, End of Service, Saudization, Nitaqat, etc.)
- **Technical Terms**: 7 system interface terms (Dashboard, Module, Integration, AI-Powered, etc.)
- **Interface Terms**: 8 UI/UX elements (Search, Filter, Export, Save, Cancel, etc.)
- **Status Terms**: 9 system states (Active, Pending, Approved, Error, Success, etc.)
- **Formatting Standards**: Date, time, currency, and number formats for both Arabic and English
- **Government Entities**: Official translations for Saudi institutions (MOL, GOSI, HRDF, TVTC)

Each term includes:
- English and Arabic translations
- Context explanation
- Usage guidelines
- Cultural considerations

### 2. Localization Style Guide (`LOCALIZATION_STYLEGUIDE.md`)
✅ **Created comprehensive 50+ section style guide covering:**

**Language Policies:**
- Arabic (MSA/Saudi dialect) as primary language
- English (International Business) as secondary
- Cultural sensitivity guidelines for Saudi business context

**Tone & Voice Guidelines:**
- Professional, authoritative, helpful, respectful tone
- Gender-neutral language strategies
- Islamic values consideration
- Saudi Vision 2030 alignment

**Formatting Conventions:**
- Date formats: DD/MM/YYYY (Arabic), MM/DD/YYYY (English)
- Time formats: 12-hour with ص/م (Arabic), AM/PM (English)
- Currency: "amount ريال" (Arabic), "SAR amount" (English)
- Hijri calendar support

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Saudi labor law compliance references
- Government integration terminology
- Respectful address and formal language rules

### 3. ESLint Governance Rules (`eslint-plugins/aqlhr-localization.js`)
✅ **Implemented custom ESLint plugin that:**

**Detects Hardcoded Strings:**
- JSX text nodes with user-facing content
- String literals in JSX attributes
- Template literals with translatable text
- Object properties that should use translations

**Validates Translation Keys:**
- Checks if translation keys exist in approved term bank
- Ensures proper key format (category.term)
- Prevents unauthorized terminology

**Smart Detection Logic:**
- Ignores technical identifiers, URLs, CSS classes
- Identifies user-facing patterns
- Validates against comprehensive term bank

### 4. Enhanced Translation System
✅ **Created governed translation infrastructure:**

**useGovernedTranslations Hook:**
- Loads translations from YAML term bank
- Validates all translation keys against approved terms
- Provides formatting functions for currency, dates, numbers
- Error tracking for governance violations
- Metadata access for translation context

**Migration Tools:**
- Automated migration script for existing translations
- Translation categorization system
- Migration reporting and validation

## Technical Implementation

### ESLint Integration
```javascript
// Updated eslint.config.js with governance rules
"aqlhr-localization/no-hardcoded-strings": "error",
"aqlhr-localization/use-approved-keys": "error"
```

### Translation Governance Enforcement
- **Term Bank Validation**: All translation keys must exist in `terms.yaml`
- **Category Structure**: Organized terms by domain (business, technical, interface, status)
- **Cultural Compliance**: Built-in Saudi business context and Islamic values
- **Format Standards**: Consistent date, currency, and number formatting

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Zero Hardcoded Strings**: ESLint prevents any user-facing hardcoded text
- **Consistent Terminology**: Single source of truth for all HR terms
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Enforced appropriate language for Saudi context
- **Government Compliance**: Official translations for regulatory terms

---

## Governance Framework Established

### Content Standards
- All user-facing text must use approved translation keys
- New terms require addition to term bank before usage
- Cultural and legal compliance built into translation process
- Quality assurance through automated validation

### Development Workflow
1. **Term Addition**: New terminology added to `terms.yaml` with context
2. **Translation Review**: Native speaker and cultural validation
3. **Code Implementation**: Use governed translation hooks
4. **Automated Validation**: ESLint enforcement at build time

### Quality Metrics Tracking
- Translation coverage percentage
- Governance violation detection
- Cultural appropriateness scoring
- User experience consistency measurement

## Impact & Benefits

### Immediate Benefits
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth eliminates terminology conflicts
- **Quality**: Cultural and linguistic review process ensures appropriateness
- **Compliance**: Built-in Saudi business and legal terminology standards
- **Maintainability**: Centralized translation management

### Long-term Value
- **Scalability**: Governance framework supports platform growth
- **Localization Readiness**: Infrastructure for additional languages
- **Brand Consistency**: Unified voice across all touchpoints
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated compliance with Saudi standards

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files Created:
- `localization/terms.yaml` - Central terminology database
- `LOCALIZATION_STYLEGUIDE.md` - Comprehensive style guidelines
- `eslint-plugins/aqlhr-localization.js` - Custom ESLint governance rules
- `scripts/migrate-translations.js` - Migration automation tool
- `src/hooks/useGovernedTranslations.ts` - Governed translation hook

### Modified Files:
- `eslint.config.js` - Added governance rules enforcement
- `package.json` - Added js-yaml dependency for YAML processing

---

## Validation Commands

### Run Localization Checks
```bash
# Check for governance violations
npm run lint

# Migrate existing translations
node scripts/migrate-translations.js

# Validate translation coverage
npm run build
```

### Development Guidelines
- Use `useGovernedTranslations()` hook instead of `useAPITranslations()`
- All new text must be added to `terms.yaml` first
- Follow style guide for tone, formatting, and cultural considerations
- ESLint will prevent hardcoded strings from being committed

---

**Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

The localization governance foundation is now established with:
- 50+ approved HR terminology entries
- Comprehensive cultural and linguistic guidelines
- Automated enforcement through ESLint
- Migration tools for existing content
- Quality assurance framework

Ready to proceed to Phase 2 upon your approval.
